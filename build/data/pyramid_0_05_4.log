	*** fldecomp will be removed in a future release of Fluidity. ***

	flredecomp is the recommended tool for mesh decomposition.

	Replace the fldecomp workflow:

	<generate mesh>
	fldecomp -n <nparts> <other options> mesh
	mpiexec -n <nparts> fluidity <other options> foo.flml

	with the flredecomp workflow:

	<generate mesh>
	mpiexec -n <nparts> flredecomp -i 1 -o <nparts> foo foo_flredecomp
	mpiexec -n <nparts> fluidity <other options> foo_flredecomp.flml

	fldecomp is retained only to decompose Terreno meshes, which
	flredecomp cannot process.
